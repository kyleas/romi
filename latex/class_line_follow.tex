Class that computes left/right motor velocities to keep a line sensor\textquotesingle{}s centroid at center.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class that computes left/right motor velocities to keep a line sensor\textquotesingle{}s centroid at center. 

The centroid from the \doxylink{class_i_r}{IR} sensor is used to adjust wheel speeds in real-\/time, steering the robot to follow a line on the floor.
