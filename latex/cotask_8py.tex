\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains classes to run cooperatively scheduled tasks in a multitasking system. 

Tasks are created as generators, functions which have infinite loops and call {\ttfamily yield} at least once in the loop. References to all the tasks to be run in the system are kept in a list maintained by class {\ttfamily Co\+Task\+List}; the system scheduler then runs the tasks\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily run()} methods according to a chosen scheduling algorithm such as round-\/robin or highest-\/priority-\/first.
